## Technical Specifications

### Core Architecture
```kotlin
class GateKeeperCore : Service() {
    // Unified device management system
    val deviceManager = DeviceManager(context)
    
    // Real-time communication hub
    val commandBus = MQTTCommandBus("ssl://gatekeeper-hub:8883")
    
    // Security enforcement engine
    val policyEngine = PolicyEngine(
        rules = listOf(GeofenceRule(), DataLimitRule(), AppRestrictionRule())
    )
    
    // Automated task scheduler
    val taskScheduler = WorkManager.getInstance(context)
}
```

### Enhanced Mirroring Protocol
```
1. Request Screen Capture (WebSocket)
2. Establish WebRTC Connection (DTLS-SRTP)
3. Stream H.265 Video (Adaptive Bitrate)
4. Input Channel (Encrypted Websocket)
5. Bi-directional File Transfer (QUIC Protocol)
```

## Setup Guide

### Initial Configuration
1. Create administrator profile
2. Define device groups
3. Set global policies
4. Configure alert thresholds
5. Establish geofence boundaries

### Device Enrollment
```mermaid

    participant Admin
    participant ParentApp
    participant Hotspot
    participant ChildDevice
    
    Admin->>ParentApp: Initiate Enrollment
    ParentApp->>Hotspot: Generate QR Code
    ChildDevice->>Hotspot: Scan QR Code
    Hotspot->>ChildDevice: Push Configuration
    ChildDevice->>ParentApp: Registration Request
    ParentApp->>ChildDevice: Assign Policies
    ParentApp->>Admin: Enrollment Complete
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Remote Management Workflow
1. Select target device from dashboard
2. Choose action:
   - Live View (Screen Mirroring)
   - File Explorer
   - App Management
   - Command Terminal
3. Execute commands in real-time
4. Review audit log of actions

### Automated Policy Enforcement
```python
# Sample geofence rule
def check_geofence(device):
    if device.location not in SAFE_ZONES:
        send_alert(f"Device {device.id} left safe zone")
        if device.policy.auto_lock:
            device.lock()
            
    if device.location in RESTRICTED_ZONES:
        device.suspend_internet()
```
